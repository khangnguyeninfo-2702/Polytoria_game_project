A fast-paced, high-intensity zombie survival game built from the ground up on **Polytoria**. This project is a spiritual successor and total revision of a previous Roblox title, refined for shorter, more explosive gameplay sessions without losing the nail-biting tension of a final stand.

## 🎯 The Vision
Most zombie games focus purely on individual survival. **Shopkeep's Stand** shifts the focus to **Objective Defense**. 
* **The Mission:** Protect the Shop. If the shutters fall, the game is over.
* **The Philosophy:** Shorter match lengths, higher stakes, and deep character customization.

## 🛠️ From Roblox to Polytoria
This project marks a transition in engines. By moving to Polytoria, I am focusing on:
- **Streamlined Mechanics:** Removing "bloat" from the original Roblox version to keep the combat snappy.
- **Enhanced Class Systems:** Leveraging Polytoria’s scripting API to create more distinct player roles.
- **Community-Centric Design:** Building a game specifically tailored to the Polytoria ecosystem.

## 🎭 Character Builds & Roles
Success depends on how you spend your **Perk Points**. Players can specialize into distinct roles:

| Role | Playstyle | Key Feature |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Artificer** | Tactical / Trap-based | Uses Gears and automated defenses. |
| **The Tank** | Frontline / Defensive | High HP and built-in knockback resistance. |
| **The Glass Cannon** | High Risk / High Reward | Extreme damage, but dies in 1-2 hits. |
| **The Gearhead** | Utility / Support | Buffs teammates and repairs the shop. |
